                The NextGen Tech Forum is a dynamic event powered by Future100 &
                Centrl, designed to inspire, equip, and connect the next
                generation of tech leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers

              <p>
                We bring together students, early-career professionals,
                entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts to explore emerging
                technologies, future-driven skills, and real-world opportunities
                in the digital economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through engaging panel sessions, hands-on masterclasses, expert
                talks, and networking opportunities, the forum creates a
                launchpad for attendees to learn, grow, and build in the world
                of techâ€”no matter their starting point.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission is simple: to make tech accessible, actionable, and
                inclusive for the youth shaping tomorrow.
